# ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated! Whether it's reporting a bug,
discussing improvements, or submitting a pull request, every bit of help is
valuable.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the git.starter-template
   (<https://github.com/dylarcher/git.starter-template>) to your own GitHub
   account.
2. **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dylarcher/git.starter-template.git
    cd git.starter-template
    ```

3. **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/the-feature-alias
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
    ```

4. **Make Changes:** Implement your feature or bug fix.
5. **Test Your Changes:** Ensure your changes work as expected and do not break
   existing functionality. (While there isn't a formal test suite yet, manual
   testing is appreciated).
6. **Commit Your Changes:** Write clear and concise commit messages.

    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Add new feature" -m "Detailed description of the         feature."
    ```

7. **Push to Your Fork:** Push your changes to your forked repository.

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```

8. **Open a Pull Request:** Go to the original git.starter-template
   (<https://github.com/dylarcher/REPOSITORY_NAMESPACE>) and open a pull request
   from your forked branch to the `dev` branch of the original repository.
   Provide a clear description of your changes.
